What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I was happy with the comfort level I displayed regarding the git workflow, although the concept of pulling was not completely clear.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I realized that "pull" is a 2 in 1 command of fetch and merge.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

One thing than went over my head was to make sure to write down the name of the branch I want to push instead of "master"; out of habit I automatically write "master" still some times. I asked gary why the changes were not being displayed on Github and he pointed out my mistake.

What still confuses you about git?

Merge conflicts are still a bit confusing although I have been able to resolve them in previous challenges by myself. But there are different types of merge conflicts so I am sure there are still some I have not stumbled upon.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Very good, I enjoy working with others and having a mentor makes working thorugh a problem much smoother. I look foward to the next one.
